# Muon-Decay-Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation of double-pulse events due to muon decays in a simple scintillation detector for educational purposes written in Python.

It can be used as a complement to the code given in https://github.com/lvillasen/RedPitaya-Muon-Decay to perform the muon-decay experiment using a RedPytaya board.

## Usage
Clone the repository to Google-Drive and use any web explorer to open the jupyter notebook in Google Colab.
